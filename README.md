  The goal for this project is to analyze data available on the WPRDC site and determine the best Pittsburgh neighborhood to own a dog. The submetrics for evaluating which neighborhood is the best for dog owners are infrastructure, safety, and green space. The datasets we will be using are:
  
  1. Police Incident Blotter https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data - Nicholas
  2. City of Pittsburgh Crosswalks https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-markings/resource/632fbb91-c55d-4221-a8ad-91c72902bc61 - Nicholas
  3. City of Pittsburgh Parks https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parks - Haiwei
  4. Sidewalk to Street "Walkability" Ratio https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/sidewalk-to-street-walkability-ratio - Haiwei
  5. Neighborhoods: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2
